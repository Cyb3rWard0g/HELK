The Hunting ELK or simply the HELK is one of the first open source hunt platforms with advanced analytics capabilities such as SQL declarative language, graphing, structured streaming, and even machine learning via Jupyter notebooks and Apache Spark over an ELK stack. This project was developed primarily for research, but due to its flexible design and core components, it can be deployed in larger environments with the right configurations and scalable infrastructure.

## Goals

* Provide an open source hunting platform to the community and share the basics of Threat Hunting.
* Expedite the time it takes to deploy a hunt platform.
* Improve the testing and development of hunting use cases in an easier and more affordable way.
* Enable Data Science capabilities while analyzing data via Apache Spark, GraphFrames & Jupyter Notebooks.

## Main Features

* **Kafka**: A distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that is designed to be fast, scalable, fault-tolerant, and durable.
* **Elasticsearch**: A highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine.
* **Logstash**: A data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities.
* **Kibana**: An open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch.
* **ES-Hadoop**: An open-source, stand-alone, self-contained, small library that allows Hadoop jobs (whether using Map/Reduce or libraries built upon it such as Hive, Pig or Cascading or new upcoming libraries like Apache Spark ) to interact with Elasticsearch.
* **Spark**: A fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
* **Jupyter Notebooks**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

## Optional Features

* **KSQL**: Confluent KSQL is the open source, streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data processing against Apache KafkaÂ®. It provides an easy-to-use, yet powerful interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Kafka, without the need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python
* **Elastalert**: ElastAlert is a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch
* **Sigma**: Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner.
