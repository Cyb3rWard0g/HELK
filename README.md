# HELK [Alpha]

A Hunting ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) with advanced analytic capabilities.

![alt text](resources/images/HELK_Design.png "HELK Infrastructure")

# Goals

* Provide a free hunting platform to the community and share the basics of Threat Hunting.
* Make sense of a large amount of event logs and add more context to suspicious events during hunting.
* Expedite the time it takes to deploy an ELK stack.
* Improve the testing of hunting use cases in an easier and more affordable way.
* Enable Data Science via Apache Spark, GraphFrames & Jupyter Notebooks.

# Current Status: Alpha

The project is currently in an alpha stage, which means that the code and the functionality are still changing. We haven't yet tested the system with large data sources and in many scenarios. We invite you to try it and welcome any feedback.

# HELK Features

* **Kafka:** A distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that is designed to be fast, scalable, fault-tolerant, and durable.
* **Elasticsearch:** A highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine.
* **Logstash:** A data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities.
* **Kibana:** An open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch.
* **ES-Hadoop:** An open-source, stand-alone, self-contained, small library that allows Hadoop jobs (whether using Map/Reduce or libraries built upon it such as Hive, Pig or Cascading or new upcoming libraries like Apache Spark ) to interact with Elasticsearch.
* **Spark:** A fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
* **GraphFrames:** A package for Apache Spark which provides DataFrame-based Graphs.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

## (Docker) Accessing the HELK's Images

By default, the HELK's containers are run in the background (Detached). You can see all your docker containers by running the following command:
```
sudo docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES

```

Then, you will just have to pick which container you want to access and run the following following commands:
```
sudo docker exec -ti <image-name> bash
root@ede2a2503030:/opt/helk/scripts#
```
