    action: forcemerge
    description: >-
      forceMerge all indices older than 2 days (based on index
      creation_date) to 2 segments per shard.  Delay 120 seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce. Skip indices that
      have already been forcemerged to the minimum number of segments to avoid
      reprocessing.

      max_num_segments: 2
